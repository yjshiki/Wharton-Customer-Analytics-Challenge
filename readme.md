#Wharton Customer Analytics Challenge 2020


Chosen Prompt : Imagine that you are working on the digital ranking team of Youtube, please create a predictive model to assess which Youtube videos should be on the front page (Note: We purposefully left the specific metric of this open-ended and up to your discretion. For example, you can predict the number of views, number of likes, or likelihood of being a mega-hit or
receiving more than 600 million views). Like most classic ML tasks, while the quality of the model is important, your thought process, including why you chose the metric that you chose, is just as essential for our assessment.
